This is the replication code for the paper entitled "MODELLING THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC WARMING ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION: EVIDENCE FROM SOUTHEAST ASIAN ECONOMIES" 

This research investigates the link between climate change and Southeast Asian economies' agricultural production. Employing panel regression with fixed and random effects, the findings underscore the significant influence of climate change, particularly rising temperatures, on agricultural productivity in Southeast Asia. The results suggest that despite the inconclusive direction of the effects of temperature variability in agricultural productivity, it is observed that the countries of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam are the most vulnerable to reduction in agricultural output due to increasing warming in the region.
